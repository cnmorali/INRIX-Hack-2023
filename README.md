# PedalPal - Bike Safer! For Inrix Hack 2023

PedalPal is a cross-platform app that provides navigation routes to cyclists using the most bike-friendly paths.

Biking is a popular mode of transportation, reducing carbon footprint and promoting physical fitness! However, biking on busy streets can be dangerous, both for bicyclists, as well as other traffic. We wanted to provide a convenient and accessible way for bicyclists to get the safest possible route to their destination. Using traffic level, construction, and crash data (all provided by Inrix), in combination with Green Lanes, we aim to provide the best possible cycling experience!
