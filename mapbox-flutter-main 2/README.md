## ü§î So what is this app now?

MapBox Flutter demonstrates an implementation of MapBox in a Flutter application, along with its Maps and Navigation SDKs. We will do this by building a simple project involving a hungry you on a bicycle and a set of restaurants and cafes! üòÇ 
In the second video, we recreate a complete Uber like experience, to implement turn-by-turn navigation, and in the process also make use of the Mapbox Search APIs, Direction APIs, Reverse Geocoding and Maps SDK.

## üë©üèª‚Äçüíª Where are the instructions to get the app up and running?

Well open your browser and IDE, we have got a few things to do! Follow along as we get the app up and running.

1. Head to https://account.mapbox.com and create a new account. Then go to your account page. You will see a public access token. This is something we will need later.

2. In the same page click on **Create a token** and in the next page, add a new secret token. Make sure that the `DOWNLOADS:READ` permission is checked here. After you create the token, you must copy it somewhere else because you can only see this once. <br>

3. Now that you have both the tokens, you just need to replace them in appropriate places of the project code. Open the `starter_code/mapbox_navigation` folder and look for `pk.eyJ1IjoiYW5hZ2hhbmFpciIsImEiOiJjbG91bnZ6MGUwamZlMm9udmk4NWZ4bG85In0.vD_A9SVLXT8wN7tfBnGtbA` and `sk.eyJ1IjoiYW5hZ2hhbmFpciIsImEiOiJjbG91c3B4eDkwa3A1Mm9udmJpaGxoem16In0.xSok42v89MXe1qqGo3n-zg` in the entire project. Replace them with the tokens gotten in Step 1 and 2 respectively. To double check you can make sure that -
    * For `ios`: You must have put public token in `Runner/Info.plist` file.
    * Some `android`: You must have put public token as a string in `app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml` and secret token as a string in `gradle.properties` file.
4. To run the app in an IOS device/emulator, you will need 1 more step. Open or create `.netrc` file in your home directory. In there add the following lines:
```
machine api.mapbox.com
  login mapbox
  password <sk.eyJ1IjoiYW5hZ2hhbmFpciIsImEiOiJjbG91c3B4eDkwa3A1Mm9udmJpaGxoem16In0.xSok42v89MXe1qqGo3n-zg>
```
5. Finally open your `assets` folder and add a `config/.env` file. You can add one key-value pair there:
```
MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN="<pk.eyJ1IjoiYW5hZ2hhbmFpciIsImEiOiJjbG91bnZ6MGUwamZlMm9udmk4NWZ4bG85In0.vD_A9SVLXT8wN7tfBnGtbA>"
```

That's it. You follow these 5 steps and you should be good to go. Now I would also recommend going through the documentation for [Android](https://docs.mapbox.com/android/maps/guides/install/) and [iOS](https://docs.mapbox.com/ios/maps/guides/install/), because there is a lot more to it, like adding permissions and stuff, which I have already done for you.
